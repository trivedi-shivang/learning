# An Introduction to Javascript

JS code does not require compiler. Code runs on any device that has JS engine.
JS engine in browser is called JS Virtual Machine and is different in different browsers.

## JS Engine in nutshell.

1. The engine (embedded if it’s a browser) reads (“parses”) the script.
2. Then it converts (“compiles”) the script to the machine language.
3. And then the machine code runs, pretty fast.

## JS can

1. Send network requests.
2. Can react to user reactions.
3. Is fully integrable with HTML and CSS.
4. Remember client data.

## JS cannot

1. Cannot read/write arbitrary files.
2. Cannot communicate with other tabs/windows when those tabs are having websites from different domain, protocol or port.
